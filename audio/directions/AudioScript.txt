	Welcome to our Experiment!

	Please read the following instructions carefully.

[Screen2]
	We will present a variety of odors to you and your task will be to rate the intensity of each odor. 
	
	Intensity means how STRONG the odor is

[Screen3]
	There will be three training sessions to familiarize you with our set-up.

[Screen4]
	The first training session is to learn how to use the scale.

	Please answer the following questions.

[Screen5]
	The second session is to practice rating the intensity of odors.

[Screen6]
	There will be a three-second countdown, at "1" please place your nose into the nose-piece and sniff. 

	{Please prepare to smell}
	{3, 2, 1}
	
[Screen7]
	In between odors, there will be a short game.
	
	In the game, you will use the mouse to avoid obstacles until you reach the end of the level.

[Screen8]
	The game will start now.

[Screen9]
	The third training will be odor trials without guidance.

[Screen10]
	Now we will begin the actual experiment.

	Are you ready?
